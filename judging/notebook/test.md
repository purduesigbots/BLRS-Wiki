# Original Testing of Solutions

{% hint style="warning" %}
This analysis uses the up-to-date rubric as of August 2025. As new versions of each rubric are announced, this article will be updated shortly following. The up-to-date rubrics can be found in this article and on the [RECF website](https://kb.roboticseducation.org/hc/en-us/categories/4421404969111-Volunteers?sc=judging).

It is important to repeat each criteria of the notebook throughout the Engineering Notebook, rather than using each step once for the initial design cycle. Consistent repetition of each step will lead to higher rubric scores.

## Criteria Definition

{% hint style="info" %}
Records all the steps to test the solution, including test results. Testing methodology is clearly explained, and the testing is done by the team. Original testing results are explained and conclusions are drawn from that data.
{% endhint %}

This segment of the rubric calls for original testing, performed by the team, as well as a breakdown of the specific steps to achieve such. Testing is essential to ensure that the **solution is preforming optimally according to benchmarks set in the Identify the Problem phase of the EDP.**

Although prominent in the rubric, this section is a very common loss of points for many teams. There are many way to introduce good testing into a notebook, the first of which being to intertwine the testing with other rubric criteria. **Utilizing testing throughout the EDP can help to ensure a stronger overall approach**, which can only benefit your notebook's score.

Additionally, maintaining a consistent level of testing throughout the season is essential to receive maximum points on the rubric. **Consistently thorough testing will more easily help apply for the Repeat Design Process category, as well as showcase stronger overall testing.**

## Recording Testing Data

One of the most overlooked areas in writing a competitive notebook, testing the changes made to a robot is an oft-completed task for any team, yet still needs to be effectively documented in the notebook. Documenting the testing data for a robot or program helps to showcase various areas for improvement, as well as illustrating a tangible record of improvement throughout the notebook.&#x20;

While testing may have its own entry in the notebook, the vast majority of testing will be done in conjunction with changes to the robot, and included within those entries. As such, **it is important to establish a baseline procedure for documenting all testing early in your development process, recording this procedure in the notebook**. An established procedure for performing and recording testing helps to ensure that all testing is consistent, accurate, and reflected well within documentation.

As for how testing should be documented, that is largely specific to the subject of such testing. **As long as the steps and results are clearly outlined, the specific methods utilized can vary depending on the situation.** One way to help make the testing process more efficient is to make sure that the metrics used to test are real use-cases, and things that would need to be tested anyways. For instance, testing the speed at which a lift operates, or how fast an object cycles through the robot, are easy actions to test and things that have a real impact on a robot's performance.

The included notebook photos are from the BLRS2 Over Under ('23-'24) Notebook. While the notebook did win Design Award at the 2024 World Championship, it should be noted that this is not a perfect notebook, though it is a good example to start with.
