# Select Best Solution

{% hint style="warning" %}
This analysis uses the up-to-date rubric as of August 2025. As new versions of each rubric are announced, this article will be updated shortly following. The up-to-date rubrics can be found in this article and on the [RECF website](https://kb.roboticseducation.org/hc/en-us/categories/4421404969111-Volunteers?sc=judging).

It is important to repeat each criteria of the notebook throughout the Engineering Notebook, rather than using each step once for the initial design cycle. Consistent repetition of each step will lead to higher rubric scores.

## Criteria Definition

With the Brainstorming step of the EDP complete, the next step is to make an informed decision from the possible solutions using a set of distinct criteria. Utilizing the methods described below, in addition to fulfilling the rubric criteria, can **help to place more thought behind the decision being made and hopefully lead to a successful iteration.**

While Decision Matrices are the most common method of addressing this criteria, and for good reason, there are other methods that should be used to supplement the standard Decision Matrix. Testing is a phenomenal way to increase the amount of points scored in this criteria. **Using testing data for each solution as an additional factor in a Decision Matrix can help to make a more informed decision** for your robot, as well as stand out compared to other Engineering Notebooks.

## Selecting Solutions

After several ideas or designs have been generated amongst the team, it is time to chose the optimal path forward for that particular problem. **An optimal way to choose which idea to proceed with is to use Testing and Decision Matrices - either or a combination of both.** As the rubric does not specify an exact method of selecting a solution, the exact method is up to the team - as long as it explains why the decision is being made.

### Decision Matrices

Decision matrices can take many forms, ranging from a simple pro/con list for each idea, comparing the various benefits and drawbacks in a simple bullet point format, to full charts with many different categories. **At its core, a Decision Matrix is a visual representation of a decision being made using weighted scores for each possible solution according to set criteria.**

While choosing a particular subsystem or idea may seem obvious to the team, using a Decision Matrix can help make the reasoning behind a choice clear to other team members, advisors, and especially the Judges. To people who may not have an instinctive grasp on VEX Robotics, Decision Matrices can help break down complex decisions to something more understandable. Secondly, reviewing the factors in an important team decision can help make sure that the team is absolutely certain of their decision, and to make sure that no pieces of information were overlooked. In this regard, Decision Matrices are very effective in organizing the thoughts and process behind a decision.

It is important to define the criteria used in a Decision Matrix. For example, if scoring an Intake based on Speed, Consistency, and Ease of Construction: What do each of these mean? Are they quantified or qualitative? What does a higher score mean? How does this impact the end solution?
{% endhint %}

As for how decision matrices should be formatted in the notebook itself, there is not one clear answer. **This is mainly due to the large degree of flexibility when designing a decision matrix, regarding their form, size, and attributes.** For instance, a large table with various metrics for comparison may necessitate its own page in the notebook, while smaller tables or diagrams could be combined into one section. The main points to keep in mind are that decision matrices are distinguishable from one another, cover the intended information, and lead towards a written conclusion (we decided upon \_\_\_\_, because of \_\_\_\_ as shown in the above chart).

In addition to a Decision Matrix, real Testing data can help to supplement the rationale behind a decision, and provide more clarity into what the scores in a Decision Matrix actually mean. Testing rough prototypes of each possible solution can help provide additional context as to how each solution may perform, and can help make a more informed decision.

The included notebook photos are from the BLRS2 Over Under ('23-'24) Notebook. While the notebook did win Design Award at the 2024 World Championship, it should be noted that this is not a perfect notebook, though it is a good example to start with.
