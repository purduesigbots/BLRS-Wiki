# Identify the Problem

{% hint style="warning" %}
This analysis uses the up-to-date rubric as of August 2025. As new versions of each rubric are announced, this article will be updated shortly following. The up-to-date rubrics can be found in this article and on the [RECF website](https://kb.roboticseducation.org/hc/en-us/categories/4421404969111-Volunteers?sc=judging).

It is important to repeat each criteria of the notebook throughout the Engineering Notebook, rather than using each step once for the initial design cycle. Consistent repetition of each step will lead to higher rubric scores.

## Criteria Definition

{% hint style="info" %}
Clearly identifies the problem/design goal(s) in detail at the start of each design process cycle. This can include elements of game strategy, robot design, or programming, and should include a clear definition and justification of the design goal(s), criteria, and constraints.
{% endhint %}

Identify the Problem consists of breaking down the problem to be solved, including the constraints and criteria for doing so. This section can focus on more broad elements (the current VRC game as a whole) or smaller elements (redesigning an intake), and should be used consistently in all cases.

When considering this criteria in writing an Engineering Notebook, it is **important to repeat this step for every Design Cycle**. The objective should be to gain a sufficient understanding of the regulations and guidelines, compile insight on factors involved in the problem, and identify the general focus of your effort. One common example of this criteria is a Game Analysis segment at the beginning of the notebook. Many instances, however, do not follow up with any further analysis or statement of criteria later in the notebook, and often lose points because of this.

To obtain maximum points in this segment, it is important to repeat the criteria for every major design cycle and thoroughly analyze the problem(s) in question. Having a set of actionable goals that can be easily translated into Gantt Charts or other similar timelines also goes far to increase points earned in this category.

## Game Analysis

Following the steps of the Engineering Design Process, the first main step a team will need to take will be to define the problem in their overarching seasonal design process, which is most commonly formatted into a Game Analysis segment. The Game Analysis segment of the notebook is where the game and overall design problem is analyzed.&#x20;

### Areas of Success

Add drawings, photos, descriptions, measurements, and more to make sure there is more than enough detail. **The biggest thing to make note of when writing this section is that the Game Analysis segment is a game&#x20;**_**analysis**_**, not a game description.**&#x20;

Instead of word-for-word repetitions of the rules directly from the game manual, this segment should mainly be comprised of descriptions of how these rules could effect gameplay and design choices, or topics such as the implications of how game elements are constructed. Generally, Game Analysis segments of the notebook should include the following:

* Important rules and their implications.
* Strategies used in similar games, or games with similar aspects.
* How the autonomous period can be utilized most effectively.
* Ideas for match and design strategy.

### Design Briefs

While a Game Analysis is a large portion of fulfilling the Identify the Problem criteria, it does not leave much room in the way of repetition throughout the notebook unless conducted in multiple separate occasions. To fill this gap, Design Briefs have become more common in recent years.

A Design Brief is a **short entry, typically no more than 1-2 pages, that summarizes the problem at hand, constraints and criteria with regards to solving the problem, and an actionable plan for future steps.** Constraints are rules outside of your own parameters that must be followed when solving the problem: the robot size requirement, motor restrictions, and plastic limits as an example. Criteria are goals for solving the problem unique to your team: being able to score a certain amount of game objects, traveling the field at a certain speed, or other qualitative metrics.

{% hint style="success" %}
Including qualitative metrics (ex: objects scored per second) can serve as a reference for Testing entries - referring back to previously set goals after the creation steps of the EDP can help make a notebook more cohesive and quality.
{% endhint %}

Lastly, including an actionable plan for future steps can help tie the Design Brief in with other steps of the Engineering Design Process and improve notebook cohesion as a whole. Including a timeline, for example, can help effectively ideate the next entries in your Design Process as well as closely lead to a full Gantt Chart or timeline entry.

The included notebook photos are from the BLRS2 Over Under ('23-'24) Notebook. While the notebook did win Design Award at the 2024 World Championship, it should be noted that this is not a perfect notebook, though it is a good example to start with.
