# Select Best Approach & Plan

After explaining each of the brainstormed possible solutions, selecting the best solution should show how teams decided on the final solution. This decision should be supported through testing data and/or a decision matrix. When using a decision matrix, the importance of the criteria should be fully explained.  After the best solution has been decided, a full plan to implement the solution should be provided. &#x20;
