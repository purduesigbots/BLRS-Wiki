# Innovative Feature

Highlighting an innovative feature of your robot in the engineering notebook, this page follows the Innovate Award submission form. This page highlights a brief description of an innovative feature of a robot and pages where its documentation can be found in the Engineering Notebook. This page DOES NOT replace the Innovate Awards Submission Form, which should be placed as the LAST ENTRY in the Engineering Notebook and uploaded to Robot Events for digital notebook submissions.&#x20;
