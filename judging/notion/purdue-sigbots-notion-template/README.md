# Purdue SIGBots Notion Template

When beginning a new page in Notion, beginning with a template allows for a uniform format throughout the engineering notebook. The following templates are created as examples for teams to use as a reference. Teams are encouraged to read the Engineering Notebook Rubric before beginning to use these templates for additional information on key concepts to be included.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
These templates are for reference only. Teams should take inspiration from these templates, and create their own templates. They should NOT be copied.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
The following process does not allow the use of _**`emojis`**_, only ASCII characters. These templates include emojis in call outs that should all be deleted before exporting.\
All emojis appear as a variation of "☒☒"
{% endhint %}
