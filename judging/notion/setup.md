When Notion is opened, and a new page is created, the first thing to appear is a space for a title, and then the option to create an <mark style="color:yellow;">`Empty Page`</mark> which should be selected. After the blank page is created, to make a database, type <mark style="color:yellow;">`"/Database"`</mark> and select the <mark style="color:yellow;">`Database - Inline`</mark> option. Name the Database something useful to organize a notebook.

## Creating Templates

With a blank Database, entries can be created by clicking the <mark style="color:yellow;">`New`</mark> button at the top right of the Database view. This is highly innefficient for notebook creation as by default, this button creates empty pages. That is why Templates can be created.&#x20;

To create and edit Templates, click the <mark style="color:yellow;">`âŒ„`</mark> next to the New button, and select <mark style="color:yellow;">`New Template`</mark>. It is recommended that a template is created for each type of entry that will be repeated throughout the notebook (Team Planning, Build Logs, etc.).&#x20;

This is a recommended setup for a template to start. The title includes a generic name that can be changed for each entry, as well as a clear date to easily distinguish entries. The first property is the date of the entry. The second property is a <mark style="color:yellow;">`Multi-select`</mark> style named Category to distinguish varieties of entries where varieties such as "Brainstorming" or "Tournament Reflection" can be added for example. A <mark style="color:yellow;">`Text`</mark> style property then is added to list Authors of the entry. The final 3 properties are all <mark style="color:yellow;">`Checkbox`</mark> style to help with organization and exporting.

It may be helpful to read [Organizing Entries](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-M7yKuZ9tKe3dQn\_jauL/s/-M7yGVyBrcpSR8SDSikj/\~/changes/533/the-judging-process/using-notion-for-a-notebook/how-to-export-a-notebook#organizing-entries) before creating several entries, but it makes more sense with some entries.
