# How to Create Entries

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended that a series of templates is created before any entries are started. This will DRASTICALLY reduce the time to create the notebook, and will also help to create consistent formatting across entries.
{% endhint %}

Each entry is created by selecting the <mark style="color:yellow;">`âŒ„`</mark> next to the <mark style="color:yellow;">`New`</mark> button in the top right of the notebook database, and then selecting a prefered template.&#x20;

Be sure to make sure all properties are filled out before any content is added so that any content isn't lost or disorganized.
