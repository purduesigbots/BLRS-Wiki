# Community Resources

Throughout the VRC community, several teams and independent parties have published their own resources to help aid teams in their journey through the Judging Process. This is a brief compilation of our favorite community resources! For any questions and concerns, please reach out to us through the link on our home page.

These resources do not exist to be copied! Use the resources to help shape your own original work. Experienced judges will see copies enough to notice!

{% hint style="warning" %}
The older a Notebook or Resource becomes, the more dated it may be in accordance to the Rubric, as well as quality compared to more current sources. Regardless of whether or not it is on this page, take older resources with a grain of salt.
