# What is Judging?

If you are new to VEX Robotics, you may notice descriptions and tabs on a Competition RobotEvents page that reference Judging, Interviews, or Notebooks. These are all components of the overall Judging Process: a chance for teams to document and communicate their overall [Engineering Design Process](notebook/) across the season!

For a more thorough breakdown of the Judging Process, alongside criteria, rules, and descriptions, please visit the [RECF Guide to Judging](https://kb.roboticseducation.org/hc/en-us/categories/4421404969111-Volunteers?sc=judging). This article will serve as a very brief introduction and summary.

## What do I need to do?

The Judging process consists of two main components: the [Engineering Notebook](notebook/) and [Team Interview](interview/). Both of these are evaluated using scored rubrics, which can be found in the Guide to Judging - as well as broken down here on the Wiki!

The Engineering Notebook is a document written by teams to summarize their Engineering Design Process across the season. **The Notebook is written prior to and between attending tournaments**, and is either turned in as a physical copy (to be returned later in the day) during check-in at Tournaments or is submitted digitally prior to an event. Digital notebooks can be turned in using the link submission through RobotEvents. Please see the Guide to Judging for more logistical details and information, and **our thorough breakdown of each rubric category under** [**The Engineering Notebook**](notebook/)**.**

The Team Interview is a brief interview that will occur during the day of a tournament, but could (rarely in our experience) be scheduled digitally ahead of time! **The Interview will be conducted by a panel of Judges according to the processes outlined in the Guide to Judging, and exists for teams to develop their skills in speech and organization.** Interviews may be prompted with questions, or allow for teams to run through a "spiel" if they have one prepared. Initial Interviews will be offered to every team at the event, with potential follow-ups for award contenders. Check with your event to determine the exact format of your interviews!

## Why does Judging matter?&#x20;

The Judging process gives students a chance to develop their skills in communication: both written an verbal. The Engineering Notebook gives the opportunity for teams to **develop written and technical skills by documenting their development** process across the season, while the Team Interview allows for the **development of interview and presentation skills.**

Several Awards within the VEX Robotics Competition are contingent on the Judging Process. At every tournament, **the Excellence, Design, Innovate, and Judges awards are contingent on participation within the Judging Process,** with several more awards offered at larger events. See the Guide to Judging for Award specifics!

If your team does not wish to participate in the Judging Process - **it is totally optional!** Judging does not impact a team's performance within the tournament itself.&#x20;
