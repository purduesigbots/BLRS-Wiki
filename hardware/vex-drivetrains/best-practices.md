This video does a great job show casing some of the best practices when building a drivetrain.

### Core Components

**Bearing Blocks**

When installed, the bearing flats are mounted directly onto the VEX V5 structure and provide a stable and secure platform for the shaft to rotate. The shaft is inserted through the center of the bearing flats and is held in place by the flats, which prevent the shaft from shifting or moving out of position. They are used to drastically reduce friction when shafts and screws are used.

**Stand Offs**

Using standoffs in the design of a VEX drive base provides several advantages, most notably increased rigidity. A drive base that is not rigid enough will have a lot of wobble, causing the robot to move around unpredictably and making it difficult to control. Standoffs can help prevent this by providing a solid, immovable structure that prevents the base from flexing and shaking during movement.

**C-Channels**

C-channels come in various lengths and widths that can be easily cut and modified to suit the specific needs of the robot's design. They can be used to create a variety of structures, and act as the basic building block for drivetrains.&#x20;

One of the main advantages of using C-channels in the design of a VEX drive base is their ability to provide additional support and stability to the structure. The C-channel's U-shape allows it to distribute force evenly across its length, helping to prevent any bending or warping of the metal plates.
