# Scissor Lift

{F7100}

The scissor lift is named because of its overlapping metal bars that open and close similarly to scissors. Scissors lifts are comprised of two sets of overlapping bars, one on each side, that are able to freely rotate in respect to one another. The lift can be as simple as two crossed bars on either side of the lift, but it can also contain many repeated iterations, stacked vertically, of the ﬁrst one and be able to extend to many feet off of the ground. The upward motion is created by motors located at the base of the lift that move one edge (either the front or the back) while the other edge remains stationary but is allowed to rotate. Moving the two edges closer together will extend the lift upwards and moving them apart will lower it. 

One of the biggest advantages of a well-designed scissor lift is the fact that the weight of the load will always remain over the base of the robot and thus help the robot to remain upright. With lift systems like the four and six bar lifts, the load will be moved up in front of the base which can cause the robot to fall forward. Another advantage of the scissor lift is its collapsible nature. A scissor lift can often compress to almost completely ﬂat which allows for the robot to ﬁt within size restrictions or pass under overhead obstacles, such as those that appeared in the Toss Up competition. One of the issues with scissors lifts is the precise calibration that they demand. Both the left and right sides of the lift must move up and down in almost perfect unison. If the two sides are not aligned properly, the lift may start to bend to one side or another. This could cause a loss of game object due to a non-horizontal containment ﬁeld or cause the robot to tip over due to a center of gravity that is no longer above the base of the robot. In order to prevent this, the lift must be carefully constructed, constantly inspected, and the code should take advantage of many sensors to ensure that the motors controlling the lift are working at the same speed and power.

## Consensus

There are some situations where a scissor lift works (Sack Attack), but most of the time (Gateway, Skyrise, ITZ) they're a bad idea. Seriously, we keep thinking that we've finally found a good use for one and it turns out to be a bad idea. Don't try it, there are plenty of better lift designs out there.
