# Interview Rubric

{% hint style="warning" %}
This analysis uses the up-to-date rubrics as of September 2023. As new versions of each rubric are announced, this article will be updated shortly following. The up-to-date rubrics can be found in this article and on the [RECF website](https://kb.roboticseducation.org/hc/en-us/categories/4421404969111-Volunteers?sc=judging).

## Design Interview Rubric

### Criteria 1: Engineering Design Process

{% hint style="info" %}
Team shows evidence of independent inquiry from the beginning stages of their design process. This includes brainstorming, testing, and exploring alternative solutions.
{% endhint %}

When considering this step of the interview, it is important to reference the [Engineering Design Process](../the-design-process/) recorded in the [Engineering Notebook](../how-to-start-a-notebook/) throughout the entire interview. Structuring the interview around each step of the Design Process and talking through how the team implemented each step can be an efficient way to ensure this criteria is accomplished while providing structure to the interview.

Additionally, it is important to reference how each step of the Design Process was used and repeated throughout the season so far. Rather than just mentioning each step, describing the implementation shows a much more in-depth understanding of the Design Process.

### Criteria 2: Game Strategies

{% hint style="info" %}
Team can fully explain their entire game strategy including game analysis.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In describing the current strategy used by a team, it is important to describe how the team decided upon the strategy in the first place. Rather than simply describing what the robot does during a match, describing why the strategy was decided upon compared to other potential strategies will earn more points on the interview rubric.

Additionally, tying this criteria into the relevant steps of the Engineering Design Process can be a thorough method to illustrate understanding of the Design Process, as well as placing emphasis on how and why the strategic decision was made.

### Criteria 3: Robot Design

{% hint style="info" %}
Team can fully explain the evolution of their robot to the current design.
{% endhint %}

In addition to describing the current robot design and how it works, it is important to describe how the robot has reached its current state. Explaining previous design cycles and why they were discarded is essential to earn maximum points on the interview rubric, in addition to showcasing how what was learned from these design cycles was used in the development of the current product.

Highlighting the use of Decision Matrices and other methods of tracking overall project workflow can be a good method towards earning more points in this step, showcasing more references to the overall Design Process.

### Criteria 4: Robot Build

{% hint style="info" %}
Team can fully explain their robot construction. Ownership of the robot build is evident.
{% endhint %}

For this criteria, it is important to describe why the design was chosen, in addition to thoroughly describing the robot as a whole. Given the description of the criteria, a smooth transition from Criteria 3 to this criteria can help earn full points for both steps while still maintaining the pacing of the interview.

### Criteria 5: Robot Programming

{% hint style="info" %}
Team can fully explain the evolution of their programming.
{% endhint %}

Similar to Criteria 3, it is important to highlight the evolution of the program throughout the season in addition to descriptions of how the program works. A high scoring team will showcase that the program was developed alongside the robot using the Engineering Design Process, rather than specifically developed last-minute without much thought.

Describing how programming development was tracked using timelines and set goals, similar to what is used in the Engineering Notebook, will go a long way towards improving rubric scores for this criteria.

### Criteria 6: Team and Project Management

{% hint style="info" %}
Team can explain how team progress was tracked against an overall project timeline, team can explain management of material and personnel resources.
{% endhint %}

Though this criteria should have been touched upon in previous steps of the interview, it is important to describe process management used by the team throughout the season. Placing emphasis on how Gantt Charts or other similar timelines were used to keep robot and programming progress on track is essential to earn maximum points on the rubric for this criteria.

Additionally, referencing how various roles and projects were split among the team, as well as any specific time constraints beyond set deadlines, should be brought up to meet the second half of the criteria. Management of materials through tracking available parts and use of parts on various designs or prototypes is another beneficial process to explain.

### Criteria 7: Teamwork, Communication, Professionalism

{% hint style="info" %}
Most or all team members contribute to explanations of the design process, game strategy, and other work done by the team.
{% endhint %}

This criteria can be accomplished without much specific explanation by having each member present their role on the team, or a step of the Design Process that they may have had particular affinity for. Describing the role of each team member as they begin to present a segment of the interview is also beneficial towards being absolutely clear regarding team involvement.

Additionally, practicing the interview prior to competition can help to ensure each team member knows when to speak their part of the interview, ensuring that all team members are able to answer their segment or question without difficulty or influence.

### Criteria 8: Respect, Courtesy, Positivity

{% hint style="info" %}
Team consistently interacts respectfully, courteously, and positively in their interview.
{% endhint %}

The most effective method of ensuring this criteria has been met throughout the entire interview is to practice prior to competition. Practice can help to make sure that each team member knows when it is their turn to speak, as well as to ensure that each team member has a fair portion of the interview.
