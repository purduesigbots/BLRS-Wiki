# Limit Switch

![](https://phabricator.purduesigbots.com/file/data/e6uhtyrngcdmk4rf26js/PHID-FILE-vb2juqo4kc7k2gsoeeea/limit_switch-300x300.jpg)

The limit switch is also a digital sensor (returning 1 or 0) and acts very similarly to the [bump switch](bumper.md). When the little metal lever is up, as in the photo above, it returns a value of 1, when the little metal lever is depressed, it gives a value of 0.

Like the bumper switch, the limit switch is also easy to use and quite reliable, but fragile (otherwise known as “flimsy”). You don’t want to put this sensor in a place where it can get entangled with other robots or on a robot appendage that will hit things hard. If you did, you’d probably have to replace this sensor at the end of every match.

This sensor requires only a tiny amount of force to trigger it, as compared to the bump switch.
