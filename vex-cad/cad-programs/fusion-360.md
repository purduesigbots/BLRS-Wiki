# Fusion 360

***

## [Latest Release: 2.0.0](https://github.com/vindou/VEX-CAD-Fusion-360-Library/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

This parts library features every VRC legal part currently available, and will continue to be updated as new parts get released. This library is the second iteration of the original [Fusion 360 Library](https://github.com/vindou/VEX-CAD-Fusion-360-Library/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

#### Installation

To install the parts library, download the [zip file](https://github.com/vindou/VEX-CAD-Fusion-360-Library/archive/refs/tags/v2.0.0.zip) and follow this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhSNF\_7SHcA).

#### FAQ

Click [here](https://github.com/vindou/VEX-CAD-Fusion-360-Library/wiki) to see frequently asked questions about the library.

#### Changes

Most notably, the [Fusion 360 Add-In](https://github.com/vexcad/fusion-library/releases/download/v1.0.0/fusion\_addin\_1\_0\_0.zip) is _no longer supported_, however there are plans to re-implement the add-in in the future.

There are now files for _every length_ of structure, similar to the [Inventor library](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor/releases/tag/v1.4.0), and all motion pieces that support inserts now have individual files for every type of insert, including no insert.

Additionally, every available length for spacers, screws, and standoffs are now available.
