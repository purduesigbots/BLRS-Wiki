# Solidworks

## [Latest Release: 1.0.0](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Solidworks/releases/latest)

This library includes every length of metal for ease of use when CADing.

The recommended file structure is to have a CAD folder anywhere on your computer, and place the [latest release](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Solidworks/releases/latest) in this folder. Every new robot you create will be a new folder in the CAD folder.
