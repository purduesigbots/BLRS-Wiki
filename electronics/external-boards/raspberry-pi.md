### Features

The speed and performance of the new [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) is a step up from earlier models. The fanless, energy-efficient Raspberry Pi runs silently and uses far less power than other computers. Raspberry Pi 4 comes with Gigabit Ethernet, along with onboard wireless networking and Bluetooth. The new Raspberry Pi 4 has upgraded USB capacity: along with two USB 2 ports there are two USB 3 ports, which can transfer data up to ten times faster. The Raspberry PI 4 has support for up to two 4K displays through its two Micro HDMI Ports.
